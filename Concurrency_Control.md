# Optimistic Concurrency Control
Optimistic concurrency control assumes that transaction conflicts occur rarely and, instead of using locks and blocking transaction execution, we can validate transactions to prevent read/write conflicts with concurrently executing transactions and ensure serializability before committing their results. Generally, transaction execution is split into three phases  
### Read phase
The transaction executes its steps in its own private context, without making any of the changes visible to other transactions. After this step, all transaction dependencies (read set) are known, as well as the side effects the transaction produces (write set).
### Validation phase
Read and write sets of concurrent transactions are checked for the presence of possible conflicts between their operations that might violate serializability. If some of the data the transaction was reading is now out-of date, or it would overwrite some of the values written by transactions that committed during its read phase, its private context is cleared and the read phase is restarted. In other words, the validation phase determines whether or not committing the transaction preserves ACID properties.
### Write phase
If the validation phase hasnâ€™t determined any conflicts, the transaction can commit its write set from the private context to the database state else can abort the transaction.
