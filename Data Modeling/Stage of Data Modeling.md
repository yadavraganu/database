The process of **data modeling** typically involves several structured stages, each serving a specific purpose in designing and implementing a database system. Here's a breakdown of the key stages:

## 1. **Requirement Gathering**
- **Goal**: Understand business processes, data needs, and user expectations.
- **Activities**:
  - Interview stakeholders.
  - Analyze existing systems and workflows.
  - Identify key entities and relationships.
## 2. **Conceptual Data Modeling**
- **Goal**: Create a high-level representation of the data.
- **Output**: Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram.
- **Focus**:
  - Entities, attributes, and relationships.
  - No concern for technical details or database systems.
## 3. **Logical Data Modeling**
- **Goal**: Add structure and detail to the conceptual model.
- **Output**: Logical schema.
- **Focus**:
  - Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).
  - Primary and foreign keys.
  - Abstract data types.
  - Business rules and constraints.
## 4. **Physical Data Modeling**
- **Goal**: Translate the logical model into a physical database design.
- **Output**: Physical schema tailored to a specific DBMS.
- **Focus**:
  - Actual data types (e.g., `VARCHAR`, `INT`).
  - Indexes, partitions, constraints.
  - Performance optimization.
## 5. **Implementation**
- **Goal**: Deploy the physical model into a live database.
- **Activities**:
  - Create tables, relationships, and constraints.
  - Load initial data.
  - Set up access controls and security.
## 6. **Maintenance & Evolution**
- **Goal**: Adapt the model as business needs change.
- **Activities**:
  - Schema updates.
  - Performance tuning.
  - Documentation and versioning.
